# WritingTestableSoftware
This is a very basic implementation of a command line calculator, which uses
natural language for input/output, e.g. “three plus four” returns “seven”. This
code was written to demonstrate writing testable software, and is intended to
complement this [presentation](https://github.com/Ant-f/WritingTestableSoftware/tree/master/Presentation)
